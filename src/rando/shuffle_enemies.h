// shuffle_enemies.{c,h} — add-rando-enemy-shuffle (sprite-type substitution).
//
// Randomizes WHICH enemy sprite spawns in each dungeon room / overworld area,
// constrained so nothing crashes (GFX-sheet-safe) and nothing softlocks
// (killable in key/shutter/water rooms). A randomizer slot axis: deterministic
// from (settings, seed), reproducible for races. Mirrors the boss-shuffle
// install precedent (shuffle_boss.{c,h}) exactly: a one-shot Generate that
// installs a module-global, a Deactivate that tears it down on slot teardown /
// the fail-closed invalid-settings path, and a SelfCheck wired into
// Rando_RunAllSelfChecks.
//
// SCOPE (MVP, owner decision): sprite-TYPE substitution only. NO HP / damage /
// killable-thief / bush-enemy / absorbable axes (deferred follow-ons). NO
// sprite-group subgroup re-shuffle — the pick stays within the sheets a room
// ALREADY loads (smaller pool, zero VRAM bookkeeping, zero crash risk).
//
// Reference (constraints, NOT code): Enemizer SpriteRequirement.cs (MIT). We
// mine the per-sprite flags + room exclusion lists; the mechanism is our own.
//
// BEATABILITY: logic models NO per-room kill-clear (every CanKill<X> macro is a
// player-firepower test over bosses/mini-bosses, all EXCLUDED here — see
// design.md D7), so a table bug does NOT move placement_digest and is invisible
// to the corpus / --rando-selftest. The constraint table is therefore the SOLE
// beatability enforcer; unknown-safety sprites are marked do_not_randomize.

// NOTE: unlike boss shuffle there is no precomputed assignment table — the
// substitution is computed per-room/per-area at load time, because the
// candidate pool depends on which GFX sheets are LIVE-loaded for that
// room/area (sprite_gfx_subset_0..3), which is load-history dependent and not
// known at generation time. Determinism comes from a per-room/per-area RNG
// derived from (seed, room/area key), not from a stored permutation.

// sprite type (or the input unchanged when no substitution applies: shuffle
// inactive, the type is excluded/marker, or no valid candidate exists). The
// caller writes the result into sprite_type[k] — a pure type-byte swap; the
// bit-packed y/x bytes are NOT touched. `slot` (the entry's index in the room's
// sprite list) is mixed into the per-room RNG so two identical types in one
// room can map to different replacements deterministically.

// sprite type (or the input unchanged when no substitution applies). The caller

// (= kSpriteTilesets[sprite_graphics_index]) but BEFORE any sheet is
// decompressed. When enemy_shuffle is active in a dungeon/overworld room load it
// may RE-ASSIGN which sheet loads into subgroup slot 2 (the "themed enemy" slot)
// — widening the pool the existing EnemyShuffle_Pick* draws from (they read the
// LIVE sprite_gfx_subset_*, which this rewrites). A no-op when the shuffle is
// off, outside a room/area load (attract/menu/etc.), or when slot 2 is pinned by
// a non-substituted sprite (see shuffle_enemies.c for the eligibility +
// anti-garbage + inheritance model). `tileset_row` is the 4-byte kSpriteTilesets
// row for the load (slot N == 0 means "inherit the previously-loaded sheet").

//
// Called from SpritePrep_LoadProperties (src/sprite.c) on the per-type init
// values. Deterministic per (seed, sprite type) — every Octorok in a seed shares
// its scaled stats. Always-on with enemy_shuffle; a pure passthrough when the
// shuffle is off, so vanilla play is byte-identical. SOFTLOCK-SAFE: HP scaling
// never makes an enemy unkillable (Link can always keep attacking; bounded
// factor, clamp >= 1), and a 0-HP (non-killable) sprite is left untouched so
// NPCs/objects are unaffected.
//
// ScaleHealth: returns `base` HP scaled by a per-type factor in [0.5x .. 2.0x],
//   clamped to [1, 255]; `base == 0` returns 0.
// ScaleDamage: `sprite_bump_damage` is a flag+class byte (low nibble = damage
//   class into kPlayerDamages, high bits = immunity/special flags). We perturb
//   ONLY a plain class (value 1..8, no high bits) by a mild deterministic -1/0/+1,
//   clamped [1, 8]; flagged/boss-attack values are returned unchanged.
